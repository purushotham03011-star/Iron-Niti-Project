We grow up hearing stories where good things happen to good people, and if something goes wrong, we must have done something to deserve it. When a couple can't conceive, our society often quietly points a finger at the woman first. You have internalized that finger-pointing. Think of it this way: If you caught a viral fever, or if you developed a thyroid issue, would you feel guilty? Would you think, 'I am a failure because my thyroid isn't working'? No. You would go to a doctor and get treated. Fertility is exactly the same—it is a biological, medical process. It is not a reflection of your character, your past actions, or your worth as a woman. Please, stop being your own bully. Be your own best friend right now, because you deserve kindness, especially from yourself."

You don't owe anyone access to your private life.

The Boundary (For pushy people): 'Chinnamma/Auntie, I know you mean well, but that is a very personal topic for us, and we prefer to keep it private between husband and wife.

It is a roadblock in your body, not a curse on your soul. Millions of wonderful, kind, deserving couples face this battle. Think of this journey like driving on a road to a beautiful destination. Most people got the smooth highway. You, unfortunately, got the road filled with potholes and diversions. It is unfair, and it is difficult. But it doesn't mean you are driving wrong, and it doesn't mean you won't reach your destination. It just means your journey requires more navigation, more patience, and a skilled mechanic (your doctor) to help you along. You are not cursed; you are just on a tougher path."

Think about everything else your body does for you. It breathes without you asking. Your heart beats thousands of times a day to keep you alive. Your legs carry you through the world.

It is okay to protect your heart. Instead of trying to be 'happy,' try to just be 'present.' Don't look at the whole mountain you have to climb; it’s too scary. Just look at the ground right in front of your feet and take the next small step—the next tablet, the next scan, the next healthy meal. If the result is negative, give yourself permission to crumble. Take two days to cry under the blankets, eat comfort food, and grieve the hope you lost. That grief is real. But then, on day three, wash your face, step into the sun, and gently ask yourself, 'Okay, what is the next step?' Courage in fertility isn't about never falling down; it's about the strength to stand up, even shakily, one more time."

Read a thriller novel, learn a new dance routine on YouTube, cook a complicated recipe just for the joy of taste.

It’s okay to be frustrated with your partner even if it’s not their fault because they are the closest safe target. Imagine your emotions are like a pressure cooker. If you keep blocking the steam (the anger) because you think it's 'bad,' eventually the cooker will explode. You need to let the steam out safely. Write furious journal entries and then tear them up. Go into your room, scream into a pillow, and cry until you have nothing left. Physical exercise is also great for releasing angry energy.

It dominates every conversation, every meal, every decision. You have stopped being 'lovers' and started being 'co-managers of a medical project.' You have to kick that houseguest out of the living room sometimes. You need to consciously create a 'Fertility-Free Zone.' Make a rule: Every Friday night (or any fixed time), fertility talk is banned. No talk of doctors, injections, scans, or money. Go out for a biryani, watch a comedy movie, go for a long drive, or just sit and talk about your office gossip or politics—anything else! You need to remind yourselves why you fell in love and got married in the first place, long before this struggle started. Nurture the root of your relationship so the tree can withstand this storm."

He might be terrified inside, perhaps even more scared than you because he hates seeing you in pain and feels helpless to fix it. But he might feel that if he crumbles, the whole family structure will collapse. His calmness might be the mask he wears to stay strong for you. Instead of attacking his calm, try to uncover what's beneath it. In a quiet moment, hold his hand and say, 'When you are so quiet about this, sometimes I feel all alone in my worry. It would really help me to know what you are honestly feeling inside. Are you scared too?' Give him permission to be weak with you."

IVF is a huge physical, emotional, and financial commitment. The thought of it failing is devastating. But I want you to think about the alternative. If fear stops you from trying, then the answer is guaranteed to be 'no.' You will never know 'what if.' If you do try, even with all the fear, you are opening the door to a chance for a 'yes.' You are stronger than you know. Women go through incredible things for the sake of their children—you are already doing that, even before your child is here. Don't look at the whole scary IVF mountain. Just look at the first step: the first appointment. Then the first injection. Take it one day, one step at a time. You don't have to be fearless; you just have to be brave enough to take the next small step."

They think fertility treatment should work the same way. They don't understand the complex biology involved. Their hurry is usually because they love milestones—marriage, then baby, then school. When there is a gap, they get anxious and project that anxiety onto you. Use an analogy that makes sense in our culture. Try the Farming Analogy: 'Amma, having a baby with treatment is like growing a very special, delicate crop. We have planted the best seeds and we are watering the soil (taking medicines). But we cannot force the sun to shine or the rain to fall. We have to wait for the right season and the right conditions. If we try to pull the sprout to make it grow faster, it will die. The doctor is the expert farmer; he knows exactly when the time is right. We must trust his timeline, not the calendar.' Explain that rushing the process could harm the chances of success."

You cup your hands gently around it to protect it. It is okay to protect your heart. You don't have to jump for joy or plan the nursery yet. You just have to keep walking forward. Hope doesn't have to be a loud shout; sometimes hope is just that quiet little voice inside you at the end of a terrible day that whispers, 'I will try again tomorrow.'"
